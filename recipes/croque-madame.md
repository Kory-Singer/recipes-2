# Croque Madame

Open-faced variation

## info

* 30-ish minutes
* 4 open-face sandwiches and you will have enough béchamel for at least 4 more

## ingredients

Both

* 3 1/2 oz grated Gruyère cheese (split between sandwiches and sauce)

Sandwich

* 1 cup Gruyère cheese
* 8 slices firm white sandwich bread (or sourdough or any crusty loaf of bread)
* 4 tsp Dijon mustard (more if thick bread)
* 1/2 lb thinly sliced cooked ham
* 4 large eggs (at the end)

Béchamel sauce

* 1/3 cups Gruyère cheese
* 3 tbsp unsalted butter (plus more for pan frying)
* 3 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 2 cups whole milk
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp black pepper
* 1/8 tsp nutmeg

## steps

Sauce

1. Melt butter in a 1 1/2 quart heavy saucepan over moderately low heat
2. Whisk in flour and cook roux, whisking, 3 minutes
3. Whisk in milk and **bring to a boil**, whisking constantly
4. Reduce heat and simmer, whisking occasionally, 5 minutes
5. Whisk in salt, pepper, nutmeg, and 1/3 cup cheese until cheese is melted
6. Remove from heat

Sandwich 

1. Spread mustard evenly on slices
2. Spread 1 1/2 tbsp sauce evenly on slices
3. Sprinkle with 1 cup of cheese, 1/4 cup per slice (or whatever your stomach can handle)
4. Top each with 1 or 2 slices of ham
5. Spread more sauce on top of the ham
6. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over moderately low heat
7. When hot cook bottom of sandwiches until golden, 3 to 4 minutes total
8. Preheat broiler on low
9. Remove from heat and transfer sandwiches to baking pan
10. Broil sandwiches 4 to 5 inches from heat until sauce is bubbling and golden in spots, 2 to 3 minutes
11. Turn off broiler and transfer pan to lower third of oven to keep sandwiches warm

Finish

1. Fry an egg over medium
2. Flip in the pan instead of using a spatula to impress others and save on dishes (the trick is use butter)
3. Top sandwich with fried egg and serve
4. Repeat for all half sandwiches that will be eaten immediately

Leftovers

1. Melt 1 tbsp butter in a skillet and fry sandwich to warm up bottom
2. Preheat broiler
3. Broil for a bit
4. Fry an egg in the meantime

## notes

* Open-faced makes it easier to eat and is less bread, but cut the bread slice a bit larger if going open-faced
* A fork and knife helps
* If you go full-sandwich, don't top ham with more sauce. First pan fry each side then top one side with sauce and a bit of cheese before broiling
* Bump up ham amount if you are hungry
