## steps

Prep

1. `Cook white rice in rice cooker.`

Cook

1. `Place the potatoes into the slow cooker. Layer the carrots on top.`

2. `Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet. Add the meat and brown on all sides. Do it in batches, if needed, do not overcrowd the pan. Transfer the beef to the slow cooker.`

3. `Heat another tablespoon of the oil in the skillet. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring for about 5 minutes, until softened. Add the salt and black pepper and cook 2-3 minutes more. Transfer to the cooker.`

4. `Pour the beef broth into the skillet and bring to a boil. Scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Transfer to the slow cooker. Add the water. Cover and cook on LOW for 6-7 hours. The meat should be tender and the vegetables cooked through.`

5. `In a small saucepan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the flour and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes, until it begins to brown. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring, about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat.`

6. `Switch the slow cooker to HIGH. Scoop out 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid and mix it with the flour mixture, until smooth. Stir into the stew a little bit at a time. Stir carefully to not break up the potatoes and the carrots. Finally, add the frozen peas.
Cover the slow cooker and cook on HIGH for about 20-30 minutes, until the sauce thickens and the peas are heated. Serve the curry with white rice.`
